            To import your intraday data from Fitbit you have to setup a <code>personal API</code> endpoint through the
            Fitbit developer settings. Below is a step-by-step guide to setup this integration.
            <h4>1. Login to the Fitbit developer page</h4>
            <a href="{% static 'img/setup-1.png' %}"><img src="{% static 'img/setup-1.png' %}" width="100%" /></a>
            <p>
              Head to <a href='https://dev.fitbit.com/login'><code>https://dev.fitbit.com/login</code></a> and sign-in
              with the same Fitbit account you are using to collect data with.
            </p>

            <h4>2. Create your personal API application</h4>
            <a href="{% static 'img/setup-2.png' %}"><img src="{% static 'img/setup-2.png' %}" width="100%" /></a>
            <p>
              Head to <a href='https://dev.fitbit.com/apps/new'><code>https://dev.fitbit.com/apps/new</code></a> and enter the data
              for your personal endpoint. You need to fill in <code>Application Name</code>, <code>Description</code>, <code>Application Website</code> as well as
              links to the <code>Terms of Service</code> & <code>Privacy Policy</code>. As you are creating a personal API application and not a public endpoint, you can
              enter whatever you feel like here.
            </p>

            <h4>3. Setting up the Personal Fitbit API.</h4>
            <a href="{% static 'img/setup-3.png' %}"><img src="{% static 'img/setup-3.png' %}" width="100%" /></a>
            <p>
              The screenshot above shows the two important settings you need to get right for this integration to work:
              <ol>
                <li>Set the <code>OAuth 2.0 Application Type</code> to <code>Personal</code></li>. This allows you to get your intraday data.
                <li>
                  You need to give a <code>callback URL</code>, which is where you will be redirected to allow Open Humans to access your data.
                  This needs to be set to <code>{{fb_redirect_uri}}</code>.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <h4>4. Get your <code>client_id</code> & <code>client_secret</code></h4>
            <a href="{% static 'img/setup-4.png' %}"><img src="{% static 'img/setup-4.png' %}" width="100%" /></a>
            <p>
              Once you have filled in all the information needed in steps 2 & 3 you will be redirected to a page that
              shows you your <code>OAuth 2.0 Client ID</code> and <code>Client Secret</code>. You can copy these two values and enter them on the index page of this integration.

            This site can access and store various types of data for visitors
            and associated with connected accounts.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you connect data from <code>external data source</code>, this site will access the
            following data and store it in your Open Humans
            account.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>x</li>
            <li>y</li>
            <li>z</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The site also stores the following data when you connect accounts
            from <code>external data source</code> and Open Humans.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>an anonymous identifier for your Open Humans account</li>
            <li>authentication credentials that allow us to read &amp; write data from <code>external data source</code> to Open Humans</li>
            <li>(authentication credentials that allow us to read your data from <code>external data source</code>)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Finally, this site's hoster
            <i><a href='https://www.heroku.com'>Heroku</a></i> stores and gives
            us access to the IP addresses of visitors, and pages visited on
            this site. These logs may be stored for up to a week.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can always delete your account and all associated data from
            the <i>Dashboard</i> when being logged in.
            This includes the Open Humans and <code>external data source</code> authentication credentials,
            i.e. we won't be able to access your Open Humans &amp; <code>external data source</code>
            accounts any longer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Removing the authorization on Open Humans does not automatically
            delete your Oura archive on Open Humans; if you want this to occur,
            you should delete your account here before withdrawing from
            <a href="https://www.openhumans.org/activity/link/">this
            project</a> in the Open Humans site.
